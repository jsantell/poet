======

**[Looking for maintenance help!](https://github.com/jsantell/poet/issues/91)**

Poet has your code-blogging back. Renders markdown, jade, or any templated files as posts, tag it up with metadata that's passed into any view engine you want, instant pagination, tag and category views, and home in time for dinner.

View the source for [jsantell.com](https://github.com/jsantell/jsantell.com) to see an example of Poet in use. Much `<3` to [Brittany Fedor](http://bfedor.com/) for the sweet art!
