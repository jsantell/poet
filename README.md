Poet [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsantell/poet.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jsantell/poet)
======

Poet has your code-blogging back. Renders markdown, jade, or any templated files as posts, tag it up with metadata that's passed into any view engine you want, instant pagination, tag and category views, and home in time for dinner.

View the source for [jsantell.com](https://github.com/jsantell/jsantell.com) to see an example of Poet in use. Much `<3` to [Brittany Fedor](http://bfedor.com/) for the sweet art!

  express = require('express'),
  app     = express(),
  poet    = require('poet')( app );

poet.set({
  posts: './_posts/',
  postsPerPage: 5,
  metaFormat: 'json'
})
  .createPostRoute()
  .createPageRoute()
  .createTagRoute()
  .createCategoryRoute()
  .init();
```

### Options

* `posts` path to directory of your files of posts (default: `./\_posts/`)
* `metaFormat` format of your front matter on every blog post. Can be `yaml` or `json` (default: `json`)
* `postsPerPage` How many posts are displayed per page in the page route
* `readMoreLink` A function taking the post object as the only parameter, returning a string that is appended to the post's preview value. By default will be a function returning `<a href="{post.link}">{post.title}</a>`
* `readMoreTag` A string in a post that is rendered as a read more link when parsed. (default: `<!--more-->`)

## Posts

Posts are constructed in markdown, jade, or any templated language of your choice (read [docs](http://jsantell.github.com/poet#format)), prefixed by front matter via [YAML](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/YAML-Front-Matter) or [JSON](https://github.com/jsantell/node-json-front-matter). All attributes are stored into the post object.

## Development

To run tests, run `npm test` from the project root to run the Mocha tests.
