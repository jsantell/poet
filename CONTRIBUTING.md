# Contributing to Poet

## Reporting Issues

Please notate what is occurring, what you expect to occur, and reproducible test case, ideally a link to the repository/branch where it's occurring

## Pull Requests

* Make an issue before submitting a PR for a new feature. It may not be accepted if it's outside of the scope of Poet. Let's have a discussion first.
* Fixes and features must include **test cases**, and all tests must be passing.
* Please follow the current coding style.
* Each PR should only solve **one issue** -- if you have multiple fixes/features, please use separate PRs.
* Each PR, once approved, should be squashed down to **one commit** with a helpful message.
